Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

- Using an official project e-mail address
- Posting via an official social media account
- Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
- Participating in project discussions on GitHub, Discord, or other platforms
- Contributing code, documentation, or other content to the project

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**Email**: danamphred@gmail.com

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

We will keep all reports confidential. In potentially harmful situations, such as
ongoing harassment or threats to anyone's safety, we may need to report to
appropriate authorities, but will only do so with your explicit consent unless
legally obligated otherwise.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

## Enforcement Process

1. **Report received** - Community leader acknowledges receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation** - Gather information from all parties involved (1-7 days)
3. **Decision** - Review findings and determine appropriate action (1-3 days)
4. **Communication** - Inform involved parties of decision and consequences
5. **Follow-up** - Monitor situation to ensure resolution

## Smart Contract Specific Guidelines

Given the nature of smart contract development and the financial implications:

### Code Review Standards

- Reviews should focus on **technical merit**, not personal preferences
- Be **constructive** - explain why something should change and suggest alternatives
- Acknowledge **good work** - positive feedback is valuable
- **Respect expertise** - we all have different backgrounds and knowledge areas
- **Ask questions** rather than making demands
- **Assume good intentions** - miscommunication happens

### Security Reporting

- Report security vulnerabilities **privately** first (see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md))
- Do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities before they are patched
- Credit researchers appropriately for responsible disclosure
- Be respectful when discussing potential vulnerabilities
- Understand that smart contract security is complex - approach discussions with humility

### Technical Discussions

- Base arguments on **data, evidence, and technical merit**
- Acknowledge when you don't know something
- Be open to changing your position with new information
- Respect different implementation approaches
- Focus on the problem, not the person

## Additional Blockchain Community Standards

As a blockchain project, we additionally commit to:

- **Transparency** - Open discussion of technical decisions
- **Decentralization** - Welcoming diverse perspectives and contributions
- **Security first** - Prioritizing user safety in all decisions
- **Education** - Helping others learn about smart contracts and Cardano
- **Collaboration** - Working together with other projects and communities
